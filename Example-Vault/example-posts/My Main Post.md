# Main Title

This is a demo website for my tool [Obsidian-2-Jekyll](https://github.com/kckhchen/obsidian-2-jekyll).

The file name will be `2026-01-12-my-main-post`, since the original file name is `My Main Post` and the creation date is 12th January, 2026. The `h1` header "Main Title" will be treated as post title on the website, and the header will be removed.

## Math Processing

Any math section like a simple $a^2 + b^{2} = c^{2}$ will be rendered correctly, including math blocks: ^10d1e3

$$
\mathbb{E}\left[ \bar{X} \right] = \mathbb{E}\left[ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_{i} \right] = \frac{1}{n} \mathbb{E}\left[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_{i} \right] = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathbb{E} \left[ X_{1} \right] = \frac{1}{n} n\mu = \mu
$$

This also works with multi-line and math block with environments:

$$
\begin{align}
\mathbb{E} \left[ \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_{i} - \bar{X})^{2} \right]
&= \frac{1}{n} \mathbb{E} \left[ \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_{i}^{2} - n\bar{X}^{2} \right] \\
&= \frac{1}{n} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathbb{E} \left[ X_{i}^{2} \right] - n\mathbb{E} \left[ \bar{X}^{2} \right] \right) \\
&= \frac{1}{n}\left( n(\sigma^{2} + \mu^{2}) - n \left( \frac{\sigma^{2}}{n} + \mu^{2} \right) \right) \\
&= \sigma^{2} + \mu^{2} - \frac{\sigma^{2}}{n} - \mu^{2} \\
&= \frac{n-1}{n} \sigma^{2}
\end{align}
$$

### A Note on Code Shields

Inline code with \$'s, such as `$a fake math block$` and code blocks with \$ will remain intact:

```
$ echo "This block"
$ echo "will be safe from math detector."

$$
A math block inside a code block.
$$
```

^2863db

Wikilinks also won't be affected when inside code blocks.
```
A [[Wikilink inside a code block]] will not be processed.
An ![[image-link-inside-code-block.img]] will not be processed.
```


If you have dollar signs \$ (e.g. The apple costs 10\$ and the banana costs 5\$), please escape them with \\ so that they won't get mistaken as math environments.

### Image Links and Wikilinks

Wikilinks to [[My Another Post|Another Post]] will be transformed into Markdown link, with the link replaced to a url (`../another-post`). 

Image links such as

![[random-image-abc.gif|500]]

will be rendered to be compatible with Jekyll, along with the specified `width` (if provided).

The `.md` files found in the `_posts` folder might look broken and won't be rendered by most Markdown editors correctly, but they are compatible with Jekyll's requirements.

## Callouts

> [!INFO]
> If a callout does not have a title, the callout type will be the title.

> [!Warning] Callout Title (Warning callout)
> Optionally, a callout can have a title.

> [!quote] A Quote Callout

> [!Error] An Error Callout
> Just like the callout above, a callout can have no messages.

> [!hint] A Hint Callout
> Just another callout

> [!example]- A Foldable Example Callout
> Just like how you use it in Obsidian, a callout type followed be a +/- sign will make the callout foldable.

> [!success]+ A Foldable Success Callout But Default Open
> Callout type followed by a + will make the callout open by default.

> [!random] A not yet support callout
> A non-standard callout type or a callout type not yet supported will be in this default style.
